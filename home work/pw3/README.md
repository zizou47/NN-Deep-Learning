# Practical Work 3: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for Image Generation

This is a supporting repository you'll use for the Practical Work 3 on the chapter about image generation you'll find [here](https://cpcdoy.github.io/articles/cv/tp-3/)

## Usage

You'll find a notebook where you need to complete some functions. Follow the tutorial to complete them and you'll be able to train and run inference on your model!
