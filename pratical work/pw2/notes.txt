why CNN better than MLP :

Imagine trying to identify a cat in a photo. An MLP might struggle because it doesn’t naturally focus on parts of the image, it’ll try to look at everything at once. But a CNN starts by recognizing the edges of the cat, then the shapes like ears and eyes, and finally pieces these together to identify the whole cat. This “piece-by-piece” approach is why CNNs are so good at vision tasks and often outperform MLPs in these area

Because CNNs use a sliding window (or kernel) that moves over the input data, they are translation invariant. This means they can detect features like a nose on a face regardless of where it appears in the image. This ability to recognize features anywhere in the image makes CNNs much more powerful for computer vision tasks than classic MLPs.


process of CNN : 

1 - convolution layer,  convolve image using filter that detect edge other componentes of the image

2 - activition layer (no linear activition function), most used one, sigmoid, relu, leaky, the output  sent to next layer as input

3  pooling layer, can be seen tween conv layer and cnn archetecture, this layer reduce number of parameters and comutation
in the network, controling overfitting by reducing progressevely the spatial size of the network (max pool) it take max of each matrix to create new one contains max of value  

- the three layers can be repeat multiple times in a network make network deeper (deep learning)
